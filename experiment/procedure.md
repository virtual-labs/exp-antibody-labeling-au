#### Reagents required
 
•	 Horse radish peroxidase

•	 Sodium periodate solution

•	 Ethanol storage solution

•	 1mM Sodium acetate buffer

•	 0.2M Sodium carbonate buffer

•	 Sodium borohydride solution

•	 Borate buffer

•	 50% Glycerol

•	 PBS(Phosphate buffered saline) buffer

•	 Sepharose CL-6B
 
 
### Procedure
 
•	Dissolve 4mg of peroxidase in 1mL of water.

•	Add 200 µL of freshly prepared 0.1 M sodium periodate, and stir the solution for 20 min at
room temperature.

•	Dialyze the modified enzyme against 1mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.4) overnight
at 4oC. 

•	Adjust the pH of the dialyzed enzyme solution by adding 20 µL of 0.2 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.5) and add 1ml of IgG solution. Stir the mixture for 2 h at room temperature.

•	Add 100 µL of freshly prepared Sodium borohydride solution (4 mg/mL), and stir the
mixture occasionally over a period of 2 h at 4oC. 

•	Fractionate the mixture by gel filtration on a column of Sepharose CL-6B in PBS and determine the A280 and A403. 

•	Pool the fractions in the first peak (both A280 and A403 peaks coincide) and stored at -20 oC with Glycerol added at a final concentration of 50%.
